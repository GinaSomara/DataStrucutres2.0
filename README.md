~ About this project ~

This is a fun project that I created after completing my first Data Structures class at San Francisco State University. We had a few assignments in
class that I found very fun and also really helped me thoroughly understand Linked Lists, Queues, and Stack. I based this project after those to help demonstrate my ability to create data structures from scratch. Enjoy the colors and fun presentation!
